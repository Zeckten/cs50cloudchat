#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
A portion of this code is taken from or inspired by the tutorials on flask.palletsprojects.com and CS50's Finance.

My project, cs50cloudchat, is an online chatroom hosted at https://cs50cloudchat.herokuapp.com/. It is invite-only to prevent it from being used for unwanted purposes, but anyone with an admin account can create these invites. I have provided an admin account for grading purposes with the username "CS50" and the password "Admin50".
